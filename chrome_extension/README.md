- ```/api/upload/<vidID>```: This endpoint accepts blob data sent in streams and writes it to the video file specified by the filePath. This filePath is gotten by querying the database based on the vidID sent in the request.
When all streams have been successful, it returns a message ```Blob data received and saved```

- ```/api/done_recording/<vidID>```: This endpoint confirms that streams has stopped, amd proceeds to transcribe the data stored in the video file.
